# Week1Problem7

This problem is a basic cascade form realization of FIR filter of equation :
𝐇(𝐳) = (𝟏 + 𝟐𝐳^−𝟏 − 𝐳^−𝟐)(𝟏 + 𝐳^−𝟏 − 𝐳^−𝟐). We will also have to make this a Reference model.

The equations were realized and attatched as .jpg file , then the structure was created on simulink.
Finally it was converted to reference model.
